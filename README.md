# Line-Follower-Robot
A line follower robot is designed to detect and follow a specific path, typically either a black or white line

Line follower robots, though often considered beginner-level projects, have practical applications that extend into various real-world industries. When built using an 8051 microcontroller, they offer a hands-on way to understand embedded systems, sensor integration, and real-time decision-making. In industrial environments, similar robots are used for automating tasks such as transporting materials along fixed routes, improving efficiency and reducing human effort. In logistics and warehousing, they form the basis of automated guided vehicles that help manage inventory and streamline operations. Even in healthcare, line-following technology is used in robots that deliver medicines or supplies across different hospital units. Beyond their functional uses, developing such robots provides learners and hobbyists with essential skills that are directly applicable to more advanced robotic systems and automation technologies.
